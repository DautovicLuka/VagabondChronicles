At the beginning of each of your turns a 5 foot radius wildfire erupts centered on a random creature involved in the combat encounter, regardless of alleigance to you. If the creature is flying it instead simply combusts dealing the damage once in a 5 foot radius. The wildfires persist until your transformation ends but only 3 can exist at the same time, a random wildfire is extinguished when a new one is created. You can cast your Breath Weapon with the center of any wildfire as the origin point instead of yourself, but when you do so the damage type is changed to fire.

The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the new inventions, as well as the tools and resources required to build the final product. The process of inventing new technology isn't easy and is prone to mishaps and failures, and can rarely be expected to work perfectly immediately. Each time you attempt to learn a new infusion there is a chance that it might fail. Make an intelligence {@item tinker's tools} check at the end of every 8 hours of work, the DC is equal to 15 + the number of infusions that you already know. If you fail you must undertake the entire process again, but this time the cost is 100 gold for each unsuccessful attempt.
